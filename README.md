# Escape-Room-SP2021
As a semester-long project for my Fundamentals of Engineering Honors class, I worked with a team of 4 to design prototypes of puzzles that would be incorporated into an escape 
room. These models were created using CAD and Arduino microcontrollers. I was in charge of the software and programming/calibrating each microcontroller in the puzzles, using
imported Arduino libraries and C++.
